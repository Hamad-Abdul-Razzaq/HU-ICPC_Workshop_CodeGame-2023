\section*{\centering Format Details}
This is a 5-day long event in which the first four days will be the practice days for the participants and the last day will be the actual day for holding the competition. The layout for these four days will be given in the next section. In the practice rounds there will be two categories, Easy \& Hard. However, the actual competition will be just one and will contain all participants from both the categories. Each practice round contest and the actual competition will contain minimum seven questions.
